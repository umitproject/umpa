Useful functions which are not really related with the library.

These functions are more independented from the packet manipulations issue.

They are splitted in the following categories (modules):
    - bits -- some extra manipulations of bits
    - exceptions -- UMPA's exceptions
    - net -- network issues
    - security -- security issues
    - tools -- other unclasified functions
