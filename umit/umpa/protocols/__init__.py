"""
Already implemented protocols and API to implement another.

Modules which names start with '_' prefix are for developers
and they are useful to implement new protocols.

Available protocols are in modules without '_' prefix.

Names of protocol's fields are inherited from wireshark filter:
see: http://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/ for more.
For these which are not defined and mostly they are used rarely (like Padding),
names from RFC documents are used.
