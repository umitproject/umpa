UMPA test suite
===============

py.test[1] is used as a framework for tests.

All tests are formally unit tests. Because UMPA is a Python's module
both unit and system tests are written as python files.

The difference between unit and system testsuites is:

unit tests - cover small pieces of code separately (e.g. functions or methods
             behaviour/functionality)
system tests - cover bigger parts of program with the full workflow and
               exptected results of functionality

Tests are splitted into the following directories: unit, system.

Running tests:
--------------

In main directory there is a executable file `run-tests.sh`.
You can run tests by running py.test (the package is included in UMPA sources)
directly with passing testsuite. E.g. $ py.test tests
