# this example shows how to send broken packets with not saved layers order

import umit.umpa
import umit.umpa.utils.security

from umit.umpa.protocols import IP, TCP

# NOTE:
# to create RAW_SOCKET we need SUID, but for normal usage it's not
# necessary. we recommend to use umpa.utils.security to make our programs
# more safety. also dropping priviliges should be done at the same beginning
# of the application

# dropping unnecessary priviliges
umit.umpa.utils.security.drop_priviliges()

# create new IP object
ip = IP()
# setting some fields
ip.src = "127.0.0.1"
ip.dst = "67.205.14.183"

# the same for TCP
tcp = TCP()
# setting some fields
tcp.srcport= 2958
tcp.dstport = 0

# also, flags will be set up. here SYN + ACK
tcp.set_flags('flags', syn=True, ack=True)

# create new packet with strict=False
# we can build compleate insane packets now
packet = umit.umpa.Packet(strict=False)
# packing protocols into our packet
# NOTE: the order of the protocols are abnormal
# you will get the warning.
# you can switch off warnings if needed: packet.warn = False

packet.include(tcp, ip)

# creating new socket connection
# NOTE: we need to raise our priviliges.
# we can call super_priviliges() function and pass function which need these
# priviliges as an argument. after that, we drop priviliges automatically

# we can do the same with the code:
# umit.umpa.utils.security.super_priviliges()
# sock = umit.umpa.Socket()
# umit.umpa.utils.security.drop_priviliges()

sock = umit.umpa.utils.security.super_priviliges(umit.umpa.Socket)

# sending packet
sock.send(packet)
