Introduction
============

UMPA is a packet generation and manipulation library. It aims to provide
an easy-to-use system to manipulate packets on every layer of the OSI model.
UMPA supports many sophisticated features, including:

  * auto-generating packets - defaults are provided for most fields
  * high-level editing of header fields - no knowledge of bit-level
    representation needed
  * auto-filling - checksum/length fields are generated automatically
  * interaction system - reacting and responding to network events
  * sniffing and sending packets - easy communication with the real world 

The goal of the project is to get a powerful, easy to use and intelligent
packet manipulation tool suitable both for beginners and experienced users.
UMPA has a wide range of uses, including network diagnostics, auditing,
stress testing and network stack debugging.
