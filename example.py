# This an example of how to use UMPA

import umpa
from umpa.protocols import IP, TCP

# create new IP object
ip1 = IP.IP()
# setting some fields
ip1.source_address = "127.0.0.1"
#ip1.destination_address = "127.0.0.1"
ip1.destination_address = "67.205.14.183"

# the same for TCP
tcp1 = TCP.TCP()
tcp1.source_port = 2958
tcp1.destination_port = 0

# also, SYN flag will be set up
tcp1.set_flags('control_bits',syn=True,ack=True)

# create a new packet and include one protocol (ip1)
packet = umpa.Packet(ip1)
# packing another protocol into our packet
packet.include(tcp1)

# creating new socket connection
sock = umpa.Socket()

# sending packet
sock.send(packet)
