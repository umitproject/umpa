"""
Global extensions which add extra usability / features.

Extensions may change behaviour of the library or add extra functionality.
In general, it's similar to plugins system.

There are 2 ways to load an extension:
 1. by load_extension() function for local and global extensions
    (e.g. C{umpa.extensions.load_extension("XML")}),
 2. by import statement
     - global example: C{import umpa.extensions.XML},
     - local example: C{import umpa_plugins.extensions.XML}

@note: Extensions have to be single .py files.
