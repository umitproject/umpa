"""
Schedule feature is for sending packets.

2 features are provided:
 1. delay before start sending
 2. interval before each packet

send() function is provided and new method for umpa.Socket objects is added.

@attention: This extension works in blocking-way. The main process is being
blocked during delays. It will be rewritten in the asynchronous way soon.
Be patient.
