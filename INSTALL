== I. INTRODUCTION ==

=== A. Audience ===

	This document is written for people who intend to build or install
	UMPA. It's recommended to use binaries release of the latest release.

=== B. Dependencies ===

	UMPA is developed in Python programming language.
	For sniffing functionality you need to install libpcap library and
	one of the python's wrappers for libpcap library.
	Currently, only modified (by UMPA development team) pypcap is supported.
	To download it, please visit: http://umpa.umitproject.org/PypcapModified
	
	All changes to the original version are sent to the author and we strongly
	believe that they will be attached in near future.

== II. INSTALLATION ==

=== A. Installing from binaries Tarball or ZIP ===

	The binaries are available under following address:

	http://www.umitproject.org/umpa/download/

	Download the suitable file and extract it. Copy dirs and files
	where you want.

=== B. Installing from binaries EXE (Windows only) ===

	The EXE binaries are available under following address:

	http://www.umitproject.org/umpa/download/

	Download the suitable file and run it.

=== C. Building from sources Tarball or ZIP ===

	The sources are available under following address:

	http://www.umitproject.org/umpa/download/

	Download the suitable file and extract it. Change the current directory
	to the extracted UMPA's directory and run the command:

	{{{
		./setup.py install
	}}}

	Perhaps, you should run it with root's priviliges.

=== D. Building from the SVN ===

	Check out the latest files by running the following command:

	{{{
		svn co http://svn.umitproject.org/svnroot/umit/branch/UMPA
	}}}

	Run the sh script by the following command:

	{{{
		sh UMPA/install_scripts/utils/create_packages.sh
	}}}

	Binaries and sources Tarball will be created in UMPA/dist directory.

	If you preffer to use UMPA/setup.py directly, remember to generate
	the API documentation before by the following command:

	{{{
		sh UMPA/install_scripts/utils/create_docs.sh
	}}}

== III. UNINSTALL PROCESS ==

=== A. UNIX ===

	There is a shell script suitable for this process.

	It's located in:
	 * install_scripts/uninstall_linux.sh -- for sources and SVN repository
	 * $PREFIX/share/umpa/scripts/uninstall_linux.sh -- for already installed UMPA

=== B. Windows ===

	If you installed UMPA by the EXE installer, you can simple use removeUMPA.exe
	application which is located in your Python base directory
	(C:\Python2.5 for example).

	If you didn't use the EXE installer, you have to remove umpa directories manually.
	They are located on Python's installation path (C:\Python2.5\ for example).
	{{{
		$PYTHON_DIR\Lib\site-packages\umpa
		$PYTHON_DIR\share\doc\umpa
		$PYTHON_DIR\share\umpa
	}}}
